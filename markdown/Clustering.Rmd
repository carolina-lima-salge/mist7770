# debate where to partition data
# some say it is not needed because unsupervised learning is not
# concerned with prediction
# others say it is needed to avoid overfitting
# we will pull a random sample of the data to create the clusters
# since we donâ€™t have a target to use to create data partition
# and also because the data is very large!

df1 <- sample_n(df, 50000)

# create cluster of pick up regions (columns 2 and 3)
clusters <- kmeans(df1[, 2:3], 5, nstart = 25) # create 5 clusters
# the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island
# 25 random sets to be chosen

# save the cluster number in the dataset as column 'borough'
df1$borough <- as.factor(clusters$cluster)

# cluster structure
str(clusters)
# cluster: which cluster does this observation belong to?
# centers: a matrix of the center of each cluster
clusters$centers
# size: the number of observations in each cluster
clusters$size # cluster 5 has the most observations
